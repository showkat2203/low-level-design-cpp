# Restaurant Management System - Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Interview Question

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a Restaurant Management System in C++. It is designed to showcase Object-Oriented Design (OOD) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The system models real-world entities and scenarios typically encountered in a restaurant setting, making it suitable for OOD interview discussions.

## Key OOD Concepts Illustrated

### 1. **Encapsulation**
- **Class Design**: The system encapsulates data and behaviors within classes such as `Customer`, `Manager`, `Table`, `Order`, and `Payment`. Each class has private or protected member variables to maintain control over its internal state.
- **Access Control**: Public methods are provided to interact with the private data members, demonstrating proper access control.

### 2. **Inheritance**
- **Class Hierarchy**: The project demonstrates inheritance through the `Person` base class and its derived classes, such as `Customer`, `Employee`, `Manager`, `Chef`, `Waiter`, and `Receptionist`. This allows for code reuse and establishes a clear hierarchical relationship.
- **Employee Roles**: Specialized behaviors of different employee types (`Manager`, `Chef`, etc.) are implemented through inheritance, showcasing how to extend base functionality.

### 3. **Polymorphism**
- **Payment Processing**: The system uses polymorphism with the `Payment` base class and its derived classes (`Cash`, `Check`, `CreditCard`). The `initiateTransaction()` method is overridden in each derived class to provide specific implementations for different payment methods.
- **Virtual Functions**: The use of virtual destructors and methods ensures that the correct overridden method is called, which is crucial for runtime behavior in polymorphic scenarios.

### 4. **Abstraction**
- **Real-World Entities**: The system abstracts complex restaurant operations into manageable entities like `Menu`, `Order`, `Reservation`, and `Table`. Each class represents a specific aspect of the restaurant, hiding the complexity of its implementation and exposing a simplified interface.
- **Interfaces for Actions**: Methods such as `placeOrder()`, `reserveTable()`, and `payBill()` abstract the underlying complexity of interacting with orders, reservations, and payments.

## Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Although not explicitly implemented here, the system design could easily accommodate a factory pattern for creating different types of `Payment` objects based on user input, showcasing how design patterns fit into OOD.
- **Strategy Pattern**: The different `Payment` classes (`Cash`, `Check`, `CreditCard`) illustrate how a strategy pattern could be applied for selecting different payment methods at runtime.

## Interview Focus Areas

### 1. **Class Design and Relationships**
- Explain the rationale behind using inheritance for `Person` and `Employee` classes. How does this structure promote reusability and maintainability?
- Discuss the use of composition in the `Customer` class, which has `Account` and `Address` members. Why is composition used here instead of inheritance?

### 2. **Polymorphism in Payment Handling**
- How does the `Payment` class leverage polymorphism to allow different payment types? What advantages does this provide in terms of extending the system to accommodate future payment methods?

### 3. **Encapsulation and Data Hiding**
- How does the use of private data members and public methods in classes like `Table` and `Reservation` ensure encapsulation? Why is this important for maintaining the integrity of the system?

### 4. **SOLID Principles**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class in the system is responsible for a single aspect of the restaurant, such as `Menu` for menu management and `Order` for order details.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The system is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. For instance, new payment types can be added by creating new subclasses of `Payment` without altering existing code.

### 5. **Potential Improvements**
- How could design patterns like the **Observer** pattern be integrated to manage notifications for reservations or order updates?
- Discuss how a **Factory** or **Abstract Factory** pattern could be used to simplify object creation in the system.

## Conclusion
This Restaurant Management System is a rich example of applying OOD principles to a real-world scenario. It demonstrates the use of core OOD concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, making it an ideal topic for an Object-Oriented Design interview. The project illustrates how to effectively model a system, leverage class hierarchies, and manage relationships between objects in a maintainable and extensible manner.
